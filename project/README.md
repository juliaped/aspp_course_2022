Project idea during aspp2022 course

I have a number of python scripts used in my research project, to achieve a number of things such as:

    - parsing gene and protein sequences
    - filtering gene and protein sequences
    - changing file formats
    - aligning protein sequences
    - making phylogenetic tree of aligned sequences
    - back-translating aligned protein sequences
    - running substitution analyses

During the aspp course project, I would like to combine all these scripts into a pipeline (using e.g. snakemake). At the same time, I would also like to take the chance to improve my code, since I was very new to python and was learning while scripting, so there are certainly plenty of improvements waiting to be done (many of which I have already realized thanks to this course).
